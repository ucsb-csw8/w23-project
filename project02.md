# Restaurant Menu Management System üìù

## Read these guidelines _in their entirety_ before implementing anything.

In this project, similar in structure to the Grades Management System from Lab 8, you will create a **Restaurant Menu Management System**!

Incorporate functions from multiple labs to implement an interactive program, which you can use to collect and create data needed to store restaurant menu information.

This project is intended to be implemented in an IDE, which will allow you to run your code interactively.
You will need to create several files in order to implement and test your functions as well as to run your main program.

The ‚ÄúGetting Started‚Äù section shows you the steps to modify the Main Program (Template), so that within 15-20 minutes, you should be able to have a fully running skeleton of the system.

## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

You will implement the following features for this system:

* Create an interface that allows the users to interact with the system (will use `while True` and `input()` to collect user data).
* Create a collection to store menu item information that the users can view and maintain by adding and editing entries.
* Allow the user to save the state of the system by saving the information to file and retrieving it from it.

You will need to use some code that you wrote in previous labs.

## Main Menu <a name="mainmenu"></a>

**IMPORTANT: Do NOT use any global variables.**

In your main program, you need to define a dictionary `the_menu` that has the options shown below.
```
    "L" : "List"
    "A" : "Add"
    "E" : "Edit"
    "D" : "Delete"
    "M" : "Show statistical data on"
    "S" : "Save the data to file"
    "R" : "Restore data from file"
    "Q" : "Quit this program"
```

The menu should be printed by the `print_main_menu()` function when the user starts this system.
üéä You already implemented this function in prior labs.
* You can copy it directly into the  **restaurant\_functions.py**.

The `print_main_menu()` function does not return anything, it just prints the correctly-formatted options that are provided in the dictionary.

## Main Program (Template) <a name="maintemplate"></a>

**Use the following starter code** to implement the main loop for your program:

```
from functions import *

the_menu = ... # TODO 1: add the options from the instructions
opt = None

while True:
    # print_main_menu(...) # TODO 2: define the function, uncomment, and call with the menu as an argument
    opt = input("::: Enter a menu option\n> ")
    opt = opt.upper() # to allow us to input lower- or upper-case letters

    if ...: # TODO 3: check of the character stored in opt is in the_menu dictionary
        print(f"WARNING: {opt} is an invalid menu option.\n")
        continue

    print(f"You selected option {opt} to > {the_menu[opt]}.")

    if opt == ...: # TODO 4: quit the program
        print("Goodbye!\n")
        break # exit the main `while` loop

    # Pause before going back to the main menu
    input("::: Press Enter to continue")

print("Have a nice day!")
```

**Important:** Every time you see the `:::` and `>` in the prompts, it denotes the call to the `input()` function as shown in the starter code. After the `"::: Press Enter to continue"` prompt is displayed and the user presses Enter, the system is set up to print the main menu at the start of the loop.

## Getting Started <a name="gettingstarted"></a>

1. Create the requested Python files.
1. Copy the above template into your **main program file**.
1. Upload the files to Gradescope to ensure the names are correct. **You will need to submit _all_ files at _the same_ time to Gradescope (not in zyBooks).**
1. Address the TODO comments in the code (including adding the `print_main_menu()` to the **restaurant\_functions.py**)

Now, you are ready to create the `if`/`elif` branches to call the functions for the various menu options. 
In the rest of the instructions, you will get to implement the rest of the options, defining the needed functions, and calling them (remember to remove the `TODO` comments).

## Create the test file <a name="testfile"></a>

For _each function that **returns** something_ in the **restaurant\_functions.py** file, you should add the corresponding `assert` statements to the **restaurant\_tests.py**.  # TODO: Please confirm the file name (restaurant_functions.py or functions.py)

For now, since the next steps will rely on it:
* add the `get_written_date()` function implementation from [LAB 7.18](https://learn.zybooks.com/zybook/UCSBCMPSCW8MatniFall2022/chapter/7/section/18) to the **restaurant\_functions.py** # TODO: Please upload new links for LAB 7.18 W23
* add the `assert` statements to check the function correctness in your **test file** 

If you see an `AssertionError`, check the `line` number that the error message pointed to.
In IDLE, you can select the **"Show Line Numbers"** option from the top "Options" menu.


**Pro Tip**: As you are reading the instructions, immediately begin adding the `assert` statements.
* test various conditions, especially, the edge cases
* copy into a comment the part of the instructions that the assert is supposed to test

You should now have a basic structure for the system, and you are ready to begin implementing each option.

TODO: Once you assembled the above template and your main program, and the testing code runs without any errors, **submit your files to Gradescope**.

We hope that you enjoy putting this project together!
