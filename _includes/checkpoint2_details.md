## Checkpoint 2: due {{site.checkpoint2 | date: "%a, %b %d, %H:%M" }} <a name="checkpoint2"></a>

Checkpoint 2 assignment will open up on Gradescope as soon as Checkpoint 1 closes.

To get a full score for Checkpoint 2, make sure that you correctly implemented the **"Delete"**, **"Restore"** and **"Save"** menu options and everything that they need. 

- Upload the requested files shown above with the required functions added to them.
- Add the code and proper documentation (i.e. docstrings and comments) for all functions.
- You should already have the function stubs and the documentation for the rest of the functions that are not required to be implemented here (i.e. the menu options for **"Update"** and **"Show average price"**) - full functionality is not required for this checkpoint but you are welcome to include it as well.
