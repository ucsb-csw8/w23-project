During your first lab working on this project, create the required files listed above and verify that you can submit them all at once to Gradescope. If you run into any issues, let the TAs and/or ULAs know during your first lab working on this project.

To get full score for Checkpoint 1, make sure that you correctly implemented the **"List"**, **"Add"**, and **"Quit"** menu options and everything that they need (see their respective sections about what functions they require).

- Upload the requested files shown above with the required functions added to them.
- Add the code and proper documentation (i.e. docstrings and comments) for all functions.
- Add the function stubs and the documentation for the rest of the functions that are not implemented here - full functionality is not required for this checkpoint but you are welcome to include it as well.
